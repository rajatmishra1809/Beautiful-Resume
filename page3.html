        <h2>Hackathons & Projects</h2>
        <p>My journey into web development was turbo-charged by participating in various hackathons.</p>
        <p>I had the opportunity to compete in hackathons like **Data Quest** and **TechXTempore**, as well as other overnight events. These intense sessions were crucial for me to rapidly learn and apply new web development concepts, work under pressure, and collaborate with talented peers.</p>
        <p>Through these experiences, I built a strong foundation and a love for creating innovative projects from scratch.</p>
